### Markdown

* [Homepage](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.


### GitHub Flavored Markdown

* [Syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.


### Fountain

* [Homepage](http://fountain.io)
* [Syntax](http://fountain.io/syntax)
* [Scrippets](http://fountain.io/scrippets)

Fountain is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing screenplays in plain, human-readable text. Fountain allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer or tablet, using any software that edits text files.

Taking its cues from John Gruber’s [Markdown][], Fountain files are eminently readable. When special syntax is required, it is straightforward and intuitive.

#### Scrippets

With Fountain Scrippets, you can add boxes of nicely-formatted script to your blog. It even works in comments.

EXT. ANCIENT ROME — DAY

ANTONIUS and IPSUM are walking down a tiny, crowded street.

ANTONIUS
Do you think in a thousand years, anyone will remember our names?

IPSUM
Not yours. But they'll know mine. Because I intend to write something so profound that it will be remembered for the ages. Designers in the 20th Century will call for Lorem Ipsum whenever they need to fill text blocks.

### CriticMarkup

* [Homepage](http://criticmarkup.com)
* [Syntax](http://criticmarkup.com/users-guide.php)

CriticMarkup is a way for authors and editors to track changes to documents in plain text. As with Markdown, small groups of distinctive characters allow you to highlight insertions, deletions, substitutions and comments, all without the overhead of heavy, proprietary office suites.


### Pandoc

* [Homepage](http://pandoc.org)

If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife.
